These files were generated from the course 'Deterministic Methods in Operations Research". Using Gurobi to solve problems. The goal is:
-how to model complex decision-making problems using linear and mixed-integer linear programming approaches
-in-depth understanding of linear programming (LP) theory (LP geometry, duality, sensitivity analysis) and solution
-methods (simplex, interior-point methods)
-basic understanding of mixed-integer linear
-programming (MILP) modeling and solution
-methodologies (branch-and-bound, cutting plane)
